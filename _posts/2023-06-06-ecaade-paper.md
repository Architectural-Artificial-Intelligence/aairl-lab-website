The AAIRL is so happy to announce that our paper “Think AI-side the Box” has been accepted to the 41st eCAADe conference in Graz, Austria!

 The theme of this year’s conference is `Digital Design Reconsidered`, which suits the zeitgeist of today with all the new AI driven technologies that are currently on the rise. The conference aims to provide a forum for open reflection and reconsideration of the last decades of digital design in architecture, to capture the current discourse on the digital in architecture.

Our paper, which was written with the help from our dear friends Agata Dalach and Dr-Ing Gerhard Schubert from the Technical University of Munich (TUM)  and Nikolas Martelaro from Carnegie Mellon University, explores how architecture students use generative AI image generating models for architectural design. After conducting a workshop with 25 of our architecture students from Ariel University, we analyzed how useful are these models during the architectural design process. The results were fascinating, insightful, and undoubtedly motivating for us to continue to push and re-examine the boundaries between architectural design and the digital space. 
We`d like to warmly thank our architecture students for their creativity and passion for the field. If not for them, we wouldn’t’ve had our paper.

Graz- here we come!
