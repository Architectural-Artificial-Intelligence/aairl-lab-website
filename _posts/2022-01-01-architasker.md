We published a new paper that provides an overview of “Architasker”, a large-scale crowdsourcing approach, platform, and method that enables a collaborative professional architectural design process in collaboration with a community of stakeholders.

The platform includes communicating complex architectural project requirements; solution space exploration using different micro-tasks like sketching, 2D and 3D CAD; design selection; and design review as an evolutionary process.

The architectural crowdsourcing model underlying the platform is contextualized in the state-of-the-art research on creative crowdsourcing methods and is supported by relevant evidence from empirical experiments. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the method to generate architectural artifacts by harnessing the skills, talents, and experience of architects and the opinions and values of the stakeholders.
