Imagine a future where architects can design the way they are used
to today but get additional expert support from computational
systems. Can an integrated digital design assistant support
architects while modeling and sketching - assisting them
seamlessly like an expert looking over their shoulder?

This future is the future vision of the CDP // Collaborative Design
Platform research group at the Chair of Architectural Informatics
in the TU Munich School of Engineering and Design focuses on
the direct, seamless integration of digital tools into the creative
design process.

Founded in 2010, our team conducts research in the direct
field of tension between intuitive human-machine interfaces,
gamification methods, and artificial intelligence in urban planning
and architectural design. The core of our research is an interactive
architectural and urban design platform that serves as a seamless
interface between established physical tools and interactive
digital tools. In this way, the CDP // Collaborative Design Platform
supports decision-makers with the calculation and presentation
of objective criteria at a very early stage.

This lecture will present an overview of the CDP research
work and the state-of-the-art tools developed for future
architecture practice.

Dr. -ing. Gerhard Schubert is the Director of Research at the
Department of Architecture and Senior Researcher at the Chair for
Architectural Informatics at Technische Universität München. He
studied architecture at TU München with a focus on urban planning,
graduated as valedictorian in 2006, and finished his doctoral thesis
in 2014 with the highest distinction. Since September 2015, he
has held the position of director of research at the architecture
department.
