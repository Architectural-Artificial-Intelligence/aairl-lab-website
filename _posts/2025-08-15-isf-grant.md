We are thrilled to announce that our lab has been awarded a prestigious grant from the Israel Science Foundation (ISF)! This achievement marks a significant milestone for our team and opens up exciting new horizons for advancing collaboration between humans and AI in the design world.

The ISF is the leading organization funding groundbreaking scientific research throughout Israel. Winning an ISF grant is both an honor and a testament to the potential impact and novelty of our proposed research.

Our project, “Towards Human-AI Collaboration: An Investigation into Effective Design Communication Modalities Within Chat Interfaces”, sets out to transform how designers, architects, and everyday users interact with AI. At its heart, the project aims to bridge the gap between human creativity and AI’s emerging capabilities, particularly in tackling design problems.
Design problems are complex, iterative, and involve multiple stakeholders—clients, professionals, and communities. Solutions are often subjective and require nuanced conversation, negotiation, and reflection. Traditional computer approaches can fall short in addressing these richly contextual, visual, and interactive exchanges.

By leveraging conversational AI (chatbots) and advanced visual communication techniques, our research seeks to make design dialogue more intuitive, accessible, and effective. Imagine a world where an architect, a city planner, or even a community member can seamlessly discuss, sketch, and critique design concepts with intelligent AI—right inside a familiar chat interface.

The coming years promise exciting developments as we share findings, tools, and resources with the academic community, design practitioners, and the public. Stay tuned—there’s much to come!
