We are excited to announce that three presentations about the ongoing research have been accepted to The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/urbanstudiesisrael/">Israeli Urban Studies Community</a> conference in October!

Our [Arc. Orly Moas-Cohen]({% link _members/orly-moas-cohen.md %}), [Gilad Chalfon]({% link _members/gilad-chalfon.md %}), and [Ela Moyal]({% link _members/ela-moyal.md %}) will present and discuss each of their projects:

Orly's project investigates how natural disasters can be an opportunity for urban renewal, using places like Hiroshima, Japan, and New Orleans, Louisiana, as case studies. 

Ela's research gives a new perspective regarding urban revitalization in Tel Aviv, looking into and assessing the implementation, implications, and prospects of facade renovation projects. 

Finally, Gilad will present a study investigating how "Smart" parking applications can be tools in tech-based privatization and part of a broader control mechanism. 

We are excited to see all the scholars at the conference and discuss our research!
