We are thrilled to announce a groundbreaking research agreement between the Architectural AI Research Lab (AAIRL) and [Green Group](https://www.green-group.co.il/), a leading urban renewal project company in Israel. This collaboration marks a significant step in developing a novel AI tool to revolutionize decision-making in urban renewal projects at the city level.

Urban renewal in Israel is a complex challenge that requires creative solutions to improve national resilience, improve citizens' lives, and preserve the natural open spaces through urban densification. Recognizing the potential of information technologies to transform this field, Green Group has agreed to fund AAIRL to research and develop cutting-edge deep learning technologies. This partnership aims to create a novel tool that will assist governments, cities, architects, and developers make informed, data-driven decisions. The primary goal is to analyze big urban data and predict the best locations for urban renewal transformations to send a ripple effect throughout the city. By leveraging AI, we aim to identify key areas that, when revitalized, will significantly facilitate more investments.

Green Group has long been at the forefront of urban renewal in Israel, known for its bottom-up, community-driven approach to creating modern, sustainable urban environments. Green Group reaffirms its commitment to Israeli innovation and its vision of leading the market in urban renewal by investing in urban science research.
