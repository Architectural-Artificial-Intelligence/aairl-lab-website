The AAIRL has collaborated with <a href="https://mtrl.net.technion.ac.il/">MTRL</a> from the Israel Institute of Technology and the <a href="https://www.probogota.org/?lang=en">Pro Bogota Region</a>, a planning agency from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogot%C3%A1">Bogotá</a>, Colombia, to explore how AI technology, specifically large language models (such as ChatGPT), can enhance inclusive design discussions in large-scale urban development endeavors. 

Led by our very own [Dr. Michelle L. Oren]({% link _members/michelle-oren.md %}), we are utilizing a Spanish Large-Language-Model WhatsApp Chatbot named <a href="https://wa.me/573132458365?text=Hola%Charli">Charli</a>. The research team actively involves the community of the Occidental Savannah of Bogota, Colombia, in co-design activities. This project is seamlessly integrated into an authentic planning process within the region, which is anticipated to experience substantial growth in central Colombia. Despite facing considerable obstacles such as high-income disparity, gender inequality, limited resources for urban projects and public services, and challenges related to social integration, environmental preservation, and the establishment of an efficient regional transportation network, the research contributes to addressing these issues. 

The project seeks to make a diagnosis and propose projects on a regional scale within the Probogotas region's `Metropolitan Vision 2051` framework. This project aims to be a voice for the people of Bogota and let them be a part of the development of their communities.
