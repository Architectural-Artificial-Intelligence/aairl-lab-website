The AAIRL has collaborated with <a href="https://mtrl.net.technion.ac.il/">MTRL</a> from the Israel Institute of Technology and the <a href="https://www.probogota.org/?lang=en">Pro Bogota Region</a>, a planning agency from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogot%C3%A1">Bogotá</a>, Colombia, to explore how AI technology, specifically large language models (such as ChatGPT), can enhance inclusive design discussions in large-scale urban development endeavors. 


The project seeks to make a diagnosis and propose projects on a regional scale within the Probogotas region's `Metropolitan Vision 2051` framework. This project aims to be a voice for the people of Bogota and let them be a part of the development of their communities.
