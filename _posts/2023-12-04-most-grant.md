Ariel University's Artificial Intelligence in Architecture Research Lab (AAIRL), under the leadership of Dr. Jonathan Dortheimer, has been awarded a substantial grant from the Ministry of Science and Technology. This funding, set to span over three years, will be instrumental in developing a pioneering machine learning model to predict and evaluate the socio-economic impacts of urban renewal projects across Israel.

The project team comprises distinguished experts, including Prof. Tal Grinshpun from the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management at Ariel. As the project's co-researcher, Prof. Grinshpun brings a wealth of expertise in artificial intelligence algorithms and optimization problems. Dr. Haya Berma, a seasoned researcher with a rich background in psychology and machine learning algorithms, will spearhead the project, providing invaluable insights into the social aspects of urban life.

The project will leverage data from local authorities, including Tel Aviv, Hadera, and Rehovot, to develop this innovative model. It is anticipated to bring about a paradigm shift in Israel's urban planning and development strategies.
