Our very own Dr. Michelle L. Oren has been mentioned in the Brazilian journal "Geocracia”- a geo-legal magazine for lawyers. During an interview, Michelle makes a 360-degree analysis of smart cities, their virtues and limitations, especially political and social ones.
The magazine coins the term `Geocracy`- the concept that geoinformation is also a citizen's right. Geoinformation refers to a wide range of data or information that is associated with a specific location and is typically collected using various technologies, including satellites, aerial surveys, GPS, and ground-based sensors. After being processed and analyzed, this data plays a crucial role in many fields and industries, including urban planning, environmental management, disaster response, transportation, agriculture, and natural resource exploration.

In her 2-part interview, Michelle discusses how even though aggregated data can lead to wonderful forecasting capabilities, which allows cities to better anticipate events and respond in a timely manner to a growing variety of threats, most cities and municipalities are far behind when it comes to using `Big Data` and AI. She also explains why we need smart cities and why we need them now: “The justifications oscillate between the unprecedented size of cities and the risks posed by the dangerous management of urban growth, both of which are highly dependent on innovation and technological solutions”.
