A new conference paper with our partners from the Technion Arc. Eytan Mann and Prof. Aaron Sprecher.

This paper envisions a pipeline for automating the generation of augmented reality tours of contested heritage sites while employing a critical approach toward the representation of history. Through the design of a generative pipeline, the paper identifies and discusses the potential and pitfalls associated with extracting spatial features from archival manuscripts and presenting them using an augmented reality application. The paper proposes a number of design approaches that assist in automating the transformation of manuscripts into interactive tours while taking into consideration historical, narrative, and technical challenges.
