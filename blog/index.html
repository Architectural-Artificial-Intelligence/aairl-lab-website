  <p data-search="We published a new open access research paper Architectural design decisions are primarily made through an interaction between an architect and a client during the conceptual design phase  However  in larger scale public architecture projects  the client is frequently represented by a community that embraces numerous stakeholders  The scale  social diversity  and political layers of such collective clients make their interaction with architects challenging  A solution to address this challenge is using new information technologies that automate design interactions on an urban scale through crowdsourcing and artificial intelligence technologies  However  since such technologies have not yet been applied and tested in field conditions  it remains unknown how communities interact with such systems and whether useful concept designs can be produced in this way  To fill this gap in the literature  this paper reports the results of a case study architecture project where a novel crowdsourcing system was used to automate interactions with a community  The results of both quantitative and qualitative analyses revealed the effectiveness of our approach  which resulted in high level stakeholder satisfaction and yielded conceptual designs that better reflect stakeholders  preferences  Along with identifying opportunities for using advanced technologies to automate design interactions in the concept design phase  we also highlight the challenges of such technologies  thus warranting future research Read the full paper">

    This study investigates how collective intelligence emerges in crowdsourcing for architectural design. Previous studies have revealed that collective intelligence emerges from the collaboration and can outperform individual intelligence. As design is a highly collaborative practice, collective intelligence plays a vital role in the design process. In this study, we compare the structure of two architectural design crowdsourcing systems using several methods. The results of the analysis suggest that design crowdsourcing systems can give rise to the following three types of collective intelligence:
