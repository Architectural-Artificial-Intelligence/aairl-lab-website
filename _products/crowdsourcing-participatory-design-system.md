description: Architasker is an innovative design management software that uses artificial intelligence to interact with the community and engages residents in the architecture and urban design process. The software enables the community to navigate and express their opinion on various planning proposals. Finally, through this valuable communication, a plan is developed that the community supports 100%. The software allows for greater access to information and reduces the barriers of language, cultural and religious differences. By providing a platform for open dialogue and ongoing feedback, the software encourages a more democratic planning process. This can help ensure that all voices are represented in the planning process, leading to decisions more reflective of the communityâ€™s needs and desires. In addition, the software also helps to increase public trust in the planning process, as it allows the public to see their input being used in the decision-making process. This can lead to greater engagement and trust in the future.
