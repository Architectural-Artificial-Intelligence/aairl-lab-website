Dr. - ing. Gerhard Schubert is the head researcher at the [Chair of Architectural Informatics](https://www.arc.ed.tum.de/en/ai/current-affairs/)], School of Engineering and Design, Technical University of Munich, specializing in the interdisciplinary field of architecture, computer science, and perceptual psychology. With his vast knowledge and experience, Gerhard is revolutionizing design by developing and examining new design-integrated approaches for using the computer as a decision-support tool in the creative context.   

Dr. Schubert's research group, [CDP // Collaborative Design Platform](https://cdp.ai.ar.tum.de/), is dedicated to bridging the gap between established working methods and digitally supported tools. Utilizing new means of Human-Computer-Interaction and Computational Design Topics, he and his team are creating a form of design support that reduces dependency on individual interpretation of a situation. This form of design support is also helpful for public participation processes and political decision-making processes by presenting objective design parameters. 

Dr. -Schubert's work has been published in more than 40 scientific papers worldwide, earning him recognition from the scientific, political, and economic communities. With his dedication to revolutionizing the design industry, Gerhard Schubert is a major force in the field of architecture, computer science, and perceptual psychology.
