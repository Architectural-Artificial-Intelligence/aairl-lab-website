Dr. Brama is a researcher at AAIRL, specializing in deep learning and ML applications. She completed her Ph.D in neuroscience at Bar-Ilan University, where she investigated biological neural networks both theoretically, through simulations of population dynamics, and experimentally through electrophysiological recordings in-vivo. During her postdoctoral studies at Ariel University, within the Industrial Engineering and Management Department, she focused on artificial neural networks, especially in the context of cyber security, and on search heuristics. 

From 2000 to 2023, Haya served as the Chief Scientific Officer at ARK, a startup specializing in AI-based automated architectural design. Her role at ARK underscores her extensive experience and expertise in the practical implementation of AI solutions in real-world architectural applications.
