Nikolas Martelaro is an Assistant Professor at the [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/nikolas-martelaro) (HCII) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). His research focuses on augmenting the capabilities of designers by leveraging new technology and design methods. His research draws from his expertise in product design, interaction design, human-robot interaction, and mechatronic engineering to develop tools and methods that enable designers to understand people better and create more human-centered products. 

Before joining CMU, Nikolas was a researcher in the Digital Experiences group at the Accenture Technology Labs. He holds a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford's Center for Design Research, where he was co-advised by Larry Leifer and Wendy Ju.   

Nikolas's research interests include Interaction Design, Interaction with Autonomous Systems, Design Tools, and Mechatronics. He is particularly interested in developing new ways to support designers in creating more intuitive and interactive products. His research seeks to bridge the gap between design, technology, and user experience and to develop better tools and methods for designers to create products that are more humane, intuitive, and accessible.   

Nikolas works to ensure that the products of tomorrow are all designed with the user in mind and that data-driven insights and a deep understanding of the user need to inform the design process. He believes that to create truly effective products - designers must leverage both the power of technology and the human ability to recognize and solve complex problems.
