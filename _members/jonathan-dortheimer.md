Jonathan Dortheimer is an architect, educator, and innovator passionate about using technology to improve people's lives. With a career spanning over two decades, he has significantly impacted the development of cities, architecture, and digital tools. 

Jonathan is the head of the Architectural AI Research Laboratory, a senior lecturer at the [Ariel University School of Architecture](https://www.ariel.ac.il/wp/architecture/en/), and a guest scholar at the [Chair of Architectural Informatics, Technical University of Munich](https://www.arc.ed.tum.de/ai/team/jonathan-dortheimer/) in Germany. 

Jonathan completed his doctoral studies in 2021 at Tel Aviv University under the supervision of Prof. [Eran Neuman](https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/eneuman) and Prof. [Tova Milo](https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/milo). Then he had the privilege to be a postdoctoral researcher at the Material Topology Research Lab at the Technion in collaboration with the Future Automation Lab at Cornell-Tech University under the supervision of Prof. [Aaron Sprecher](https://architecture.technion.ac.il/members/aaron-sprecher/) and Prof. [Wendy Ju](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/wendy-ju/). 

In addition to his academic endeavors, Jonathan is a successful entrepreneur. He has founded several start-up companies and received three mentions in the [National Library's Israeli Internet History Project](https://20yearswebisrael.nli.org.il/). He also co-founded the [Meirim](https://meirim.org/), a website promoting democracy in urban planning in Israel. As a registered architect since 2008, he has designed over 30 projects and participated in competitions. 

Jonathan's research focuses on spatial design (buildings and cities) as a collective and political-cultural action based on technology. His approach harnesses the potential of advanced technologies to enhance human design ability, particularly emphasizing using AI to help architects address planning challenges. He has developed methods and technologies for collaborative architectural design, enabling effective collaboration between architects and communities. 

Jonathan is an active educator, teaching design, research methods, and programming. He taught courses at the Tel Aviv University (2018-2020) and the Technion (2019-2021) and lectured at TU Munich and Cornell-Tech. He also advocates for accessibility and inclusion, developing tools to integrate disadvantaged communities and people with special needs in design processes. 

Jonathan Dortheimer is an inspiring architecture, technology, and community engagement leader. His innovation and dedication to improving people's lives make him a valuable asset to any organization.
