Aaron Sprecher is an Associate Professor at the Technion Faculty of Architecture and Town Planning. He co-leads the Material Topology Research Laboratory at the Faculty of Architecture. In parallel, he is co-founder and partner of the award-winning practice Open Source Architecture, a collaborative research group that brings together international researchers in the fields of design, architecture, engineering, and media research.

He taught at Syracuse University School of Architecture (2005-2008) before joining McGill University School of Architecture (2008-2016) where he founded the Laboratory for Integrated Prototyping and Hybrid Environments (McGill LIPHE). During his tenure at McGill University, Professor Sprecher was awarded a series of research grants including the prestigious Canada Foundation for Innovation grant and two Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council grants among others.

His research and design work focuses on the synergy between information technologies, computational languages, and digital fabrication systems, examining the way in which technology informs and generates innovative approaches to design processes. Besides his publications and exhibitions, he has lectured at many institutions, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Harvard University, Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), and Rice University.

Aaron is co-curator and co-editor of the exhibition and catalogue The Gen(H)ome Project (MAK Center, Los Angeles, 2006) and Evolutive Means (Pratt Institute, New York, 2010). As conference co-chair of ACADIA 2010, he is co-editor of LIFE in:formation: On Responsive Information and Variations in Architecture (2010, New York: ACADIA), Architecture in Formationâ€”On the Nature of Information in Digital Architecture (2013, London: Routledge/Taylor and Francis) and Instabilities and Potentialities (2019, London: Routledge/Taylor and Francis).

He was a member of the Editorial Board of the Journal of Architectural Education (JAE). He is a member of the Advisory Board of the Confluence Institute in France, and a member of the Board of Directors of the Society for Arts and Technology (SAT, Montreal).
