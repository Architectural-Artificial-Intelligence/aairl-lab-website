Gal Guz is a fifth-year architecture student, UX/UI designer, and research assistant at the AAIRL at Ariel University. He specializes in designing and developing complex systems, guiding projects from user requirements and operational concept development through user testing, design language creation, and the final handoff to development, including ongoing implementation support.

Gal is involved in two projects:
* Investigating whether AI tools can simulate human behavior within built spaces to assess and measure spatial metrics.
* Designing the user interface for a research initiative aimed at predicting the social impacts of urban renewal.

In addition to his research, Gal has been developing skills in software development for the past two years, focusing primarily on the React ecosystem and integrating 3D elements using Three.js.

In his free time, Gal enjoys surfing, running, playing the guitar, and spending time with friends.
