<p>We are thrilled to share that two innovative papers from the AAIRL have been accepted for presentation at the prestigious CAADRIA 2025 conference in Tokyo. This recognition underscores our commitment to pushing the boundaries of architectural research and integrating cutting-edge technology into urban planning and design.</p>

<h3 id="ai-driven-recommendations-for-strategic-urban-renewal">AI-Driven Recommendations for Strategic Urban Renewal</h3>

<p>Authored by Dr. Haya Brama, Dr. Jonathan Dortheimer, Prof. Tal Grinshpoun, and our industry partner, Oded Landau, this paper introduces a revolutionary approach to urban renewal planning. The team has developed a decision support system that leverages advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to reimagine urban landscapes. By allowing municipal stakeholders to explore new parcel combinations, the system transcends the limitations of existing urban layouts.</p>

<p>The core of this system is its modular plugin architecture, which guarantees flexibility and transparency in decision-making. Custom-designed algorithmic solutions within these plugins address urban renewal’s specific and nuanced requirements. Moreover, deep learning techniques are employed to predict the potential of future projects based on historical data, a feature particularly beneficial for peripheral regions with low-profit margins. Successful renewal in these areas can catalyze further growth and development, making this model a powerful tool for urban planners.</p>

<h3 id="addressing-religious-code-with-computer-code-a-genetic-algorithm-approach-to-sukkah-architecture">Addressing Religious Code with Computer Code: A Genetic Algorithm Approach to Sukkah Architecture</h3>

<p>The second paper, “Addressing Religious Architectural Restrictions with Computer Code: A Genetic Algorithm Approach,” by Gaya Bitman and Dr. Jonathan Dortheimer tackles the unique architectural challenge of designing sukkah balconies in high-rise multi-residential buildings. Jewish law requires each balcony to have an unobstructed view of the sky, a stipulation that complicates architectural design and limits building heights in densely populated areas.</p>

<p>This study models the design problem as a single-objective optimization task using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), a popular method in parametric architecture. However, the research identifies significant limitations in the GA’s application to design, such as rapid convergence that restricts solution exploration and difficulties in meeting specific minimum requirements. To address these challenges, the authors propose an enhanced approach that involves executing multiple parallel, more minor GAs to improve random sampling. Additionally, they introduce an evaluation function distinct from the fitness function, allowing for selecting solutions that meet critical minimum criteria. This refined method offers a more effective strategy for designing sukkah balconies and demonstrates an improved application of GA in architectural design.</p>

This collaboration marks a significant step in developing a novel AI tool to revolutionize decision-making in urban renewal projects at the city level.</p>

<p>Urban renewal in Israel is a complex challenge that requires creative solutions to improve national resilience, improve citizens’ lives, and preserve the natural open spaces through urban densification. Recognizing the potential of information technologies to transform this field, Green Group has agreed to fund AAIRL to research and develop cutting-edge deep learning technologies. This partnership aims to create a novel tool that will assist governments, cities, architects, and developers make informed, data-driven decisions. The primary goal is to analyze big urban data and predict the best locations for urban renewal transformations to send a ripple effect throughout the city. By leveraging AI, we aim to identify key areas that, when revitalized, will significantly facilitate more investments.</p>

<p>Green Group has long been at the forefront of urban renewal in Israel, known for its bottom-up, community-driven approach to creating modern, sustainable urban environments. Green Group reaffirms its commitment to Israeli innovation and its vision of leading the market in urban renewal by investing in urban science research.</p>

<p>The theme of this year’s conference is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Digital Design Reconsidered</code>, which suits the zeitgeist of today with all the new AI driven technologies that are currently on the rise. The conference aims to provide a forum for open reflection and reconsideration of the last decades of digital design in architecture, to capture the current discourse on the digital in architecture.</p>

<p>Our paper, which was written with the help from our partners Dr-Ing Gerhard Schubert (TUM),Nikolas Martelaro (Carnegie Mellon University) and Agata Dalach (TUM), explores how architecture students use generative AI image generating models for architectural design. After conducting a workshop with 25 of our architecture students from Ariel University, we analyzed how useful are these models during the architectural design process. The results were fascinating, insightful, and undoubtedly motivating for us to continue to push and re-examine the boundaries between architectural design and the digital space. 
We`d like to warmly thank our architecture students for their creativity and passion for the field. If not for them, we wouldn’t’ve had our paper.</p>

Through the design of a generative pipeline, the paper identifies and discusses the potential and pitfalls associated with extracting spatial features from archival manuscripts and presenting them using an augmented reality application.

I have worked on this project with Nikolas Martelaro, Gerhard Schubert, and Aaron Sprecher. Here is the abstract of my talk:</p>

<p>Urban design is an institutional process aimed at developing cities and improving communities. Since cities are complex systems that include many subsystems – urban design is a particularly challenging task. As a result, urban design is usually a top-down process characterized by a disconnect between designers and residents. Critics of postmodern urban planning argued that this approach led to inferior design in major urban projects.</p>

<p>To deal with this challenge in the last 60 years, participatory design methods have gained popularity, allowing residents to participate in urban planning through various tools, such as workshops, interviews, and meetings. Some argue that participatory design practices are essential to creating “just cities” and sustainable communities. However, there are many significant challenges related to politics, knowledge gaps, distrust in the system, and lack of democratic tradition, time, and resources.</p>

<p>This project offers an artificial intelligence tool to tackle some of these challenges by automating design conversations with thousands of residents in urban projects. From the participatory design perspective, the tool allows residents to influence and intervene in design decisions before and during the planning process through conversations. We developed a chatbot using a machine learning model that can discuss an architectural project with various stakeholders and automatically generate a design brief.</p>

<p>To test the efficiency and usefulness of the technology, we conducted an experiment in which the participants talked to the chatbot about establishing a new architecture school. The system then produced a list of design requirements from the conversations, and the participants rated their accuracy. Finally, participants completed a user experience survey.</p>

<p>The experiment results indicate both the promises and the challenges of this technology. The results showed that the chatbot could hold meaningful conversations with the project stakeholders, reflect the conversation’s essence through the design requirements list and have a positive user experience. However, on the other hand, there is difficulty in controlling the conversation, and there is a lack of trust in the capabilities of artificial intelligence.</p>]]></content><author><name>jonathan-dortheimer</name></author><category term="PD" /><category term="chatbots" /><category term="AI" /><category term="participatory design" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The conference “The second conference of the Israel Urban Studies Community” will take place on the 27th of October at the Open University campus.
