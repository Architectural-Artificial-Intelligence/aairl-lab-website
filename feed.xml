<p>Led by our very own <a href="/members/michelle-oren.html">Dr. Michelle L. Oren</a>, we are utilizing a Spanish Large-Language-Model WhatsApp Chatbot named <a href="https://wa.me/573132458365?text=Hola%Charli">Charli</a>. The research team actively involves the community of the Occidental Savannah of Bogota, Colombia, in co-design activities. This project is seamlessly integrated into an authentic planning process within the region, which is anticipated to experience substantial growth in central Colombia. Despite facing considerable obstacles such as high-income disparity, gender inequality, limited resources for urban projects and public services, and challenges related to social integration, environmental preservation, and the establishment of an efficient regional transportation network, the research contributes to addressing these issues.</p>

<p>The project seeks to make a diagnosis and propose projects on a regional scale within the Probogotas region’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Metropolitan Vision 2051</code> framework. This project aims to be a voice for the people of Bogota and let them be a part of the development of their communities.</p>]]></content><author><name>lielle-brenner</name></author><category term="featured" /><category term="chatbots" /><category term="AI" /><category term="participatory design" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The AAIRL has collaborated with MTRL from the Israel Institute of Technology and the Pro Bogota Region, a planning agency from Bogotá, Colombia, to explore how AI technology, specifically large language models (such as ChatGPT), can enhance inclusive design discussions in large-scale urban development endeavors.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://aairl.com/images/news/charli.webp" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://aairl.com/images/news/charli.webp" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The AAIRL team will be presenting new research at the Israeli Urban Community conference</title><link href="https://aairl.com/featured/2023/08/11/urban-studies-conference.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The AAIRL team will be presenting new research at the Israeli Urban Community conference" /><published>2023-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-21T18:16:06+00:00</updated><id>https://aairl.com/featured/2023/08/11/urban-studies-conference</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://aairl.com/featured/2023/08/11/urban-studies-conference.html"><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to announce that three presentations about the ongoing research have been accepted to The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/urbanstudiesisrael/">Israeli Urban Studies Community</a> conference in October!</p>

<p>The theme of this year’s conference is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Digital Design Reconsidered</code>, which suits the zeitgeist of today with all the new AI driven technologies that are currently on the rise. The conference aims to provide a forum for open reflection and reconsideration of the last decades of digital design in architecture, to capture the current discourse on the digital in architecture.</p>

<p>Our paper, which was written with the help from our partners Dr-Ing Gerhard Schubert (TUM),Nikolas Martelaro (Carnegie Mellon University) and Agata Dalach (TUM), explores how architecture students use generative AI image generating models for architectural design. After conducting a workshop with 25 of our architecture students from Ariel University, we analyzed how useful are these models during the architectural design process. The results were fascinating, insightful, and undoubtedly motivating for us to continue to push and re-examine the boundaries between architectural design and the digital space. 
We`d like to warmly thank our architecture students for their creativity and passion for the field. If not for them, we wouldn’t’ve had our paper.</p>

<p>Graz- here we come!</p>

Oren has been mentioned in the Brazilian journal “Geocracia”- a geo-legal magazine for lawyers. During an interview, Michelle makes a 360-degree analysis of smart cities, their virtues and limitations, especially political and social ones.
The magazine coins the term <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Geocracy</code>- the concept that geoinformation is also a citizen’s right. Geoinformation refers to a wide range of data or information that is associated with a specific location and is typically collected using various technologies, including satellites, aerial surveys, GPS, and ground-based sensors. After being processed and analyzed, this data plays a crucial role in many fields and industries, including urban planning, environmental management, disaster response, transportation, agriculture, and natural resource exploration.</p>

<p>In her 2-part interview, Michelle discusses how even though aggregated data can lead to wonderful forecasting capabilities, which allows cities to better anticipate events and respond in a timely manner to a growing variety of threats, most cities and municipalities are far behind when it comes to using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Big Data</code> and AI. She also explains why we need smart cities and why we need them now: “The justifications oscillate between the unprecedented size of cities and the risks posed by the dangerous management of urban growth, both of which are highly dependent on innovation and technological solutions”.</p>

<p>Founded in 2010, our team conducts research in the direct
field of tension between intuitive human-machine interfaces,
gamification methods, and artificial intelligence in urban planning
and architectural design. The core of our research is an interactive
architectural and urban design platform that serves as a seamless
interface between established physical tools and interactive
digital tools. In this way, the CDP // Collaborative Design Platform
supports decision-makers with the calculation and presentation
of objective criteria at a very early stage.</p>

<p>This lecture will present an overview of the CDP research
work and the state-of-the-art tools developed for future
architecture practice.</p>

<p>This paper envisions a pipeline for automating the generation of augmented reality tours of contested heritage sites while employing a critical approach toward the representation of history. Through the design of a generative pipeline, the paper identifies and discusses the potential and pitfalls associated with extracting spatial features from archival manuscripts and presenting them using an augmented reality application. The paper proposes a number of design approaches that assist in automating the transformation of manuscripts into interactive tours while taking into consideration historical, narrative, and technical challenges.</p>

I have worked on this project with Nikolas Martelaro, Gerhard Schubert, and Aaron Sprecher. Here is the abstract of my talk:</p>

<p>Urban design is an institutional process aimed at developing cities and improving communities. Since cities are complex systems that include many subsystems – urban design is a particularly challenging task. As a result, urban design is usually a top-down process characterized by a disconnect between designers and residents. Critics of postmodern urban planning argued that this approach led to inferior design in major urban projects.</p>

<p>To deal with this challenge in the last 60 years, participatory design methods have gained popularity, allowing residents to participate in urban planning through various tools, such as workshops, interviews, and meetings. Some argue that participatory design practices are essential to creating “just cities” and sustainable communities. However, there are many significant challenges related to politics, knowledge gaps, distrust in the system, and lack of democratic tradition, time, and resources.</p>

<p>This project offers an artificial intelligence tool to tackle some of these challenges by automating design conversations with thousands of residents in urban projects. From the participatory design perspective, the tool allows residents to influence and intervene in design decisions before and during the planning process through conversations. We developed a chatbot using a machine learning model that can discuss an architectural project with various stakeholders and automatically generate a design brief.</p>

<p>To test the efficiency and usefulness of the technology, we conducted an experiment in which the participants talked to the chatbot about establishing a new architecture school. The system then produced a list of design requirements from the conversations, and the participants rated their accuracy. Finally, participants completed a user experience survey.</p>

<p>The experiment results indicate both the promises and the challenges of this technology. The results showed that the chatbot could hold meaningful conversations with the project stakeholders, reflect the conversation’s essence through the design requirements list and have a positive user experience. However, on the other hand, there is difficulty in controlling the conversation, and there is a lack of trust in the capabilities of artificial intelligence.</p>]]></content><author><name>jonathan-dortheimer</name></author><category term="crowdsourcing" /><category term="chatbots" /><category term="AI" /><category term="participatory design" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The conference “The second conference of the Israel Urban Studies Community” will take place on the 27th of October at the Open University campus.

<p>The platform includes communicating complex architectural project requirements; solution space exploration using different micro-tasks like sketching, 2D and 3D CAD; design selection; and design review as an evolutionary process.</p>

<p>The architectural crowdsourcing model underlying the platform is contextualized in the state-of-the-art research on creative crowdsourcing methods and is supported by relevant evidence from empirical experiments. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the method to generate architectural artifacts by harnessing the skills, talents, and experience of architects and the opinions and values of the stakeholders.</p>
