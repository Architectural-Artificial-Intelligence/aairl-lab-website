This achievement marks a significant milestone for our team and opens up exciting new horizons for advancing collaboration between humans and AI in the design world.</p>

<p>The ISF is the leading organization funding groundbreaking scientific research throughout Israel. Winning an ISF grant is both an honor and a testament to the potential impact and novelty of our proposed research.</p>

<p>Our project, “Towards Human-AI Collaboration: An Investigation into Effective Design Communication Modalities Within Chat Interfaces”, sets out to transform how designers, architects, and everyday users interact with AI. At its heart, the project aims to bridge the gap between human creativity and AI’s emerging capabilities, particularly in tackling design problems.
Design problems are complex, iterative, and involve multiple stakeholders—clients, professionals, and communities. Solutions are often subjective and require nuanced conversation, negotiation, and reflection. Traditional computer approaches can fall short in addressing these richly contextual, visual, and interactive exchanges.</p>

<p>By leveraging conversational AI (chatbots) and advanced visual communication techniques, our research seeks to make design dialogue more intuitive, accessible, and effective. Imagine a world where an architect, a city planner, or even a community member can seamlessly discuss, sketch, and critique design concepts with intelligent AI—right inside a familiar chat interface.</p>

<p>The coming years promise exciting developments as we share findings, tools, and resources with the academic community, design practitioners, and the public. Stay tuned—there’s much to come!</p>]]></content><author><name>jonathan-dortheimer</name></author><category term="featured" /><category term="chatbots" /><category term="AI" /><category term="PD" /><category term="funding" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are thrilled to announce that our lab has been awarded a prestigious grant from the Israel Science Foundation (ISF)!

Traditionally, these emotional responses have been hard to quantify or predict—until now.</p>

<p>At AAIRL, we’re excited to spotlight a compelling step forward in architectural design, led by a collaboration between Gal Guz, Nikolas Martelaro, Gerhard Schubert, and myself. Our new research paper, “Quantifying Architectural Experience Using Visual Language Models: Does AI Dream of Rendered Spaces?”, asks a fascinating question: Can advanced AI models predict how humans will emotionally respond to a space, even before it’s built?</p>

<p>Architecture has long depended on measurements: dimensions, materials, light. But translating the emotional impact of a space (“Is this cozy? Stimulating? Overwhelming?”) into numbers has been elusive. Each person feels space differently, which makes universal design both crucial and challenging.</p>

<p>However, recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs), like GPT-4o, open up the ability to “simulate” human experience. Imagine building not just physical models, but digital <em>synthetic humans</em> who can “walk” through your designs and tell you how they feel!</p>

<p><strong>The Experiment: AI vs. Human Feelings:</strong>
We put GPT-4o’s vision-to-emotion prowess to the test. We gathered 10 images of different spaces and asked human and AI to completed emotional ratings using the well-known PANAS scale, how each image made them feel (20 different emotions).</p>

<p>We found out:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Strong Negative Intuition:</strong>
GPT-4o’s negative emotion ratings strongly matched humans—an R² value of 0.79, rising to 0.8 after filtering out CAD images. In other words, AI was excellent at predicting spaces that felt distressing or unpleasant.</li>
  <li><strong>Positive Emotions—More Subtle:</strong>
The correlation for positive emotions was moderate overall (R² = 0.13), but improved to a “strong” connection (R² = 0.53) after removing the CAD images. Curiously, the AI tended to overrate positive feelings in highly artificial (CAD) spaces, whereas humans rated them much lower.</li>
  <li><strong>Fine-Grained Emotions:</strong>
For most individual negative emotions (afraid, upset, nervous, etc.), correlations between AI and human scores were high across the images (see Table 2 on page 9). Positive emotions were less reliably predicted, with ‘inspired,’ ‘proud,’ and ‘interested’ best reflected.</li>
</ul>

<p>This work hints at a revolutionary future in design:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>AI as a Smart Design Companion:</strong> Instead of relying solely on personal skill and intuition, architects can now lean on AI to “pre-screen” how their designs might make users feel.</li>
  <li><strong>Quantitative Emotional Metrics:</strong> Emotional experience becomes as quantifiable as daylight, circulation, or material use.</li>
  <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> With more refined AI models, it’s conceivable that design processes could optimize space not just for cost or efficiency, but for positive emotional impact.</li>
</ul>

<p>This methodology could pave the way for large-scale studies on emotional response to the built environment—including cultural or demographic adjustment.</p>

<p>This research shows real promise: AI can now help us measure and maybe someday optimize the feelings our spaces create. If “form follows function,” perhaps now it can also follow feeling.</p>

<p>We at AAIRL are eager to see how these tools empower more human-centric architecture—making the intangible, finally, a little more measurable.</p>

<p>We are thrilled to share that two innovative papers from the AAIRL have been accepted for presentation at the prestigious CAADRIA 2025 conference in Tokyo. This recognition underscores our commitment to pushing the boundaries of architectural research and integrating cutting-edge technology into urban planning and design.</p>

<h3 id="ai-driven-recommendations-for-strategic-urban-renewal">AI-Driven Recommendations for Strategic Urban Renewal</h3>

<p>Authored by Dr. Haya Brama, Dr. Jonathan Dortheimer, Prof. Tal Grinshpoun, and our industry partner, Oded Landau, this paper introduces a revolutionary approach to urban renewal planning. The team has developed a decision support system that leverages advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to reimagine urban landscapes. By allowing municipal stakeholders to explore new parcel combinations, the system transcends the limitations of existing urban layouts.</p>

<p>The core of this system is its modular plugin architecture, which guarantees flexibility and transparency in decision-making. Custom-designed algorithmic solutions within these plugins address urban renewal’s specific and nuanced requirements. Moreover, deep learning techniques are employed to predict the potential of future projects based on historical data, a feature particularly beneficial for peripheral regions with low-profit margins. Successful renewal in these areas can catalyze further growth and development, making this model a powerful tool for urban planners.</p>

<h3 id="addressing-religious-code-with-computer-code-a-genetic-algorithm-approach-to-sukkah-architecture">Addressing Religious Code with Computer Code: A Genetic Algorithm Approach to Sukkah Architecture</h3>

<p>The second paper, “Addressing Religious Architectural Restrictions with Computer Code: A Genetic Algorithm Approach,” by Gaya Bitman and Dr. Jonathan Dortheimer tackles the unique architectural challenge of designing sukkah balconies in high-rise multi-residential buildings. Jewish law requires each balcony to have an unobstructed view of the sky, a stipulation that complicates architectural design and limits building heights in densely populated areas.</p>

<p>This study models the design problem as a single-objective optimization task using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), a popular method in parametric architecture. However, the research identifies significant limitations in the GA’s application to design, such as rapid convergence that restricts solution exploration and difficulties in meeting specific minimum requirements. To address these challenges, the authors propose an enhanced approach that involves executing multiple parallel, more minor GAs to improve random sampling. Additionally, they introduce an evaluation function distinct from the fitness function, allowing for selecting solutions that meet critical minimum criteria. This refined method offers a more effective strategy for designing sukkah balconies and demonstrates an improved application of GA in architectural design.</p>

<p>The theme of this year’s conference is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Digital Design Reconsidered</code>, which suits the zeitgeist of today with all the new AI driven technologies that are currently on the rise. The conference aims to provide a forum for open reflection and reconsideration of the last decades of digital design in architecture, to capture the current discourse on the digital in architecture.</p>

<p>Our paper, which was written with the help from our partners Dr-Ing Gerhard Schubert (TUM),Nikolas Martelaro (Carnegie Mellon University) and Agata Dalach (TUM), explores how architecture students use generative AI image generating models for architectural design. After conducting a workshop with 25 of our architecture students from Ariel University, we analyzed how useful are these models during the architectural design process. The results were fascinating, insightful, and undoubtedly motivating for us to continue to push and re-examine the boundaries between architectural design and the digital space. 
We`d like to warmly thank our architecture students for their creativity and passion for the field. If not for them, we wouldn’t’ve had our paper.</p>
