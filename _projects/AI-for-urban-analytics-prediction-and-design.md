Our research encompasses several areas: predictive analysis,  AI-driven creative processes, and optimization. For example, we use historical data to predict the impact of urban renewal to help make informed, data-driven decisions. Additionally, we focus on creating sophisticated image-generating models that enable visualizing architectural designs, broadening the scope of creative possibilities. Our optimization research uses advanced algorithms to analyze complex urban data and propose effective designs.
