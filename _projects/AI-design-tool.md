In the rapidly evolving field of architecture, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming traditional design methodologies. This project aims to innovate and explore how cutting-edge AI tools can enhance the architectural design process. By focusing on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the union between human and computational creativity, we are paving the way for a new era of design thinking.

**Exploring Human-Computer Interaction**

Our research explores the dynamics of Human-Computer Interaction, examining how designers interact with AI tools and the impact of these interactions on the creative process. One of our pioneering studies revealed that designers often encounter fixation when utilizing diffusion models in architectural design. This fixation can limit creativity, highlighting the need for AI systems that support and expand the designer's creative potential.

**Synthetic Humans in Design**

A key area of our current research is the concept of synthetic humans as a design method. We are investigating how AI can be employed to understand space and human emotions during the design process. By simulating human presence and emotional responses, AI can give designers deeper insights into how real users experience spaces. 

**The Future of AI in Architectural Design**

As we continue to explore the capabilities of AI in design, our goal is to develop tools that assist designers and inspire them. By fostering a collaborative relationship between humans and machines, we aim to unlock new levels of creativity and innovation in architecture.
