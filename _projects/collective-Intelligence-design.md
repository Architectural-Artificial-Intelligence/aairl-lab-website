intro: What can generative AI do to help humans design better buildings and cities?
description: The project seeks to revolutionize how architects and urban planners design cities, buildings, and other structures by developing AI tools such as machine learning models and expert systems.

The Collective Intelligence in Architectural Design project explores and applies collective intelligence in architectural design. We firmly believe that the future of architectural design lies in harnessing the power of collective intelligence through crowdsourcing. We aim to develop a novel collaborative design method that integrates the input of various members throughout the design process rather than just at the end.
This project is a theoretical foundation for the [chatbot participatory design project](/projects/chatbots-for-design.html).

Our research is centered around the following key areas:

* Understanding how collective intelligence emerges in crowdsourcing for architectural design.
* Developing a new collaborative crowdsourcing methods for architecture.
* Creating a large-scale architectural design crowdsourcing approach, platform, and method that allows collaboration between architects and non-architect stakeholders.

Our research has led to several significant findings:

* Collective intelligence in architectural design can emerge in three forms: discussive, synthetic, and evaluative.
* The development of a new collaborative crowdsourcing method for architecture, which we term the 'DSR block,' an acronym of Design, Select, and Review.
* The creation of a large-scale crowdsourcing approach, platform, and method that enables a collaborative professional architectural design process in collaboration with a community of stakeholders.

Our work focuses on refining our crowdsourcing method and platform, conducting further experiments to validate its effectiveness, and exploring its potential applications in various architectural design contexts. We also investigate further the role of non-architect stakeholders in the design process and how their involvement can enhance the quality and relevance of architectural design.
