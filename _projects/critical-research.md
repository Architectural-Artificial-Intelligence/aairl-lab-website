Our work primarily revolves around research and development of design computation tools. However, a considerable portion of our efforts is dedicated to studying people and cities. We explore the impact of smart technologies on power structures within smart cities, examine neoliberal business models of urban renewal, and investigate the spatial appearance of religious communities and issues of gentrification in Israel.

Overall, our curiosity spans various aspects of cities, technologies, and culture, deepening our understanding of urban environments and informing our AI research.
