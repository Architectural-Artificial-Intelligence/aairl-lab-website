This award-winning research project develops and studies innovative participatory methods. The outcomes of this project provide new public participation tools that address the challenges of traditional participatory design processes, including power imbalances, knowledge gaps, communication barriers, trust issues, and the need for streamlined information flows.

**Automated Participatory Design at an Urban Scale**

In this project, we pioneer automated participatory design at an urban scale. Our chatbot technology assists planners in incorporating the public's needs and ideas into the design process by engaging stakeholders in meaningful dialogues. This approach aims to create more inclusive and representative designs on an urban scale.

**Large Language Models in Design**

The research focuses on harnessing the power of large language models (LLMs) for design purposes. The chatbots employ advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to understand and interact with users. The team investigates how this technology can stimulate creativity and facilitate fairer design solutions and more equitable cities.

**Communication of Design Concepts**

The chatbot serves as a tool for gathering input and a platform for articulating design ideas. A significant challenge is translating complex design concepts into understandable language, bridging the communication gap between designers and stakeholders. Improved communication leads to better, better design outcomes. 

**Collective Intelligence through Participatory Design on an Urban Scale**

We explore the emergence of collective intelligence in collective design. By utilizing crowdsourcing technology, architects can access many ideas and perspectives by engaging diverse communities in the design process. The team studies how this collective intelligence can be harnessed to create designs that accurately represent the communities they serve, providing that urban spaces reflect the needs and aspirations of their inhabitants.
