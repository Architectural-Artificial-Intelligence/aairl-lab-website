In this project, we pioneer automated participatory design at an urban scale. 
Our chatbot technology helps planners incorporate the public's needs and ideas into the design process by engaging stakeholders in meaningful dialogues, thereby creating more inclusive and representative designs on an urban scale.

<!-- <h3 class="details_info_title">Large Language Models in Design</h3>

The research is focused on harnessing the power of large language models (LLMs) for design purposes. The chatbots employ advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to understand and interact with users. The team studies how this technology can stimulate creativity and facilitate innovative design solutions.

<h3 class="details_info_title">Communication of Design Concepts</h3>

The chatbot serves as a tool for gathering input and a platform for articulating design ideas. A significant challenge is translating complex design concepts into understandable language to bridge the communication gap between designers and stakeholders and improve communication, leading to better, more inclusive design outcomes. The team studies how AI-human communication can be facilitated better.

<h3 class="details_info_title">Collective Intelligence through Participatory Design on an Urban Scale</h3>

The lab explores the emergence of collective intelligence at an urban scale. Using advanced chatbot technology, architects can access many ideas and perspectives by engaging diverse communities in the design process. The team studies how this collective intelligence can be utilized to create designs that accurately represent the communities they serve.  -->
