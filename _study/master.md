The Architectural AI Research Lab (AAIRL) is a part of the Master in Architecture degree that fosters research, knowledge, and skills in sustainable architecture and urbanism. Our focus is on environmental, social, and cultural considerations, combined with the application of advanced technologies. 

The Ariel School of Architecture Master's program responds to Israel's increasing global and local awareness about the significance of environmental considerations in architectural and urban planning. This is crucial to ensure the sustainability of our environments for present and future generations. Graduates from the program will be equipped to meet the pressing demand for experts in planning teams across the public and private sectors.

Our unique program equips graduates with the tools, knowledge, and ability to analyze, plan, and design concerning the ecological, social, and cultural aspects of sustainable architecture and urbanism. This empowers our graduates to take leadership roles and integrate into public planning systems, planning offices, and start-up companies.
