**What We Actually Do:** 

Our team investigates concrete problems in urban design and planning where AI can genuinely help, such as human design predictions, human-AI design processes, analyzing large-scale urban data, and developing tools for city-scale simulations. Our work is joint with industry and government, so it’s tested against the constraints and messiness of the real world, not just theory.

**Why Join AAIRL?**

- **Concrete Impact:** Our projects have great partners: municipalities, government agencies, real estate and design firms. Publications aside, we work to produce results people will actually use.
Clear Supervision: As a student or researcher here, you’ll work closely with Dr. Jonathan Dortheimer, whose backgrounds combine architecture, computer science, and urban studies. Students routinely co-author papers and are supported through the sometimes-painful publication process.
- **Funding and Support:** We have grants from agencies including the Israel Science Foundation and the Ministry of Science, Technology, and the private sector, which allow us to provide stipends, travel, and conference support to our students and staff.
- **Life Here:** Projects are intense but collaborative. We don’t expect 24/7 grinding. Quality work matters more than facetime. Our lab currently includes Ph.D, M.Sc., and postdocs from Israel, but we are open to international students! Newcomers get mentorship and are encouraged to question ideas, not just follow instructions.
- **Where Our Graduates Go:** Recent group members now work at the leading architecture firms, or have continued for further research. We’re happy to connect you with them for candid, unfiltered perspectives.
- **Who Should Apply?** 
We welcome applicants interested in research degrees (MSc, PhD), postdoctoral roles, or independent AI/urban research projects. We expect you to have a background in architecture, computer science, engineering, or urban studies, and a willingness to learn beyond your comfort zone.

**How to learn more? We invite you to:**
- Learn about [Ph.D.](https://www.ariel.ac.il/wp/graduate-school/en/applicants/), [M.Sc.](https://www.ariel.ac.il/wp/architecture/m-d/), and [postdocs](https://www.ariel.ac.il/wp/postdocs/) at Ariel University.
